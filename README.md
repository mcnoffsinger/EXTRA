What did I build?
I built a tic tac toe game where the AI will cheat by expanding the board when it is trapped. that way, more x's in a row are required to win. The AI is very difficult to beat, but it is possible, I myself have beaten it one time.

What languages/tools did I use? What AI tools did I use?
I used ChatGPT to generate all of the code. It is written in Javascript, with a linked empty HTML file. I told chatGPT what to prgram, telling it that I had an empty JS file already linked to a HTML file. Then, it revised the code each time I asked it to add something. I ended up starting over halfway through, and this time the Ai added things to the code instead of typing up new sections slowly.

What did you do vs what the AI did?
The AI basically did everything. I explained to the AI what I needed, then I pasted the code into vs code. I then tested it and told the AI what I wanted to add/fix. I found the AI did much beter when it basically built all the code in one go from the ground up. probably because it's memory of what it did in past prompts is poor.

Thing I'm proud of:
That I was able to give up on the first attempt and start from scratch, resulting in a better final product.

What could I work on: \
I could make a more intersting product that expands more on the idea of an expanding tic tac toe board. I was running out of time and this is the only feature I could implement. That being said, it's a pretty cool feature.
